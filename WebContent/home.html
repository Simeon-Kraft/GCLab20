	<h3>The Beasts</h3>
	<div class="poems">

		<p>
			The beasts are very wise,<br> Their mouths are clean of lies;<br>
			They talk one to the other,<br> Bullock to bullock's brother,<br>
			Resting after their labours,<br> Each in stall with his
			neighbours.<br> But man with goad and whip,<br> Breaks up
			their fellowship,<br> Shouts in their silky ears<br>
			Filling their souls with fears.<br> When he has tilled the land<br>
			He says, 'They understand.'<br> But the beasts in stall
			together,<br> Freed from yoke and tether,<br> Say, as the
			torn flanks smoke,<br> 'Nay, 'twas the whip that spoke.'

		<h3>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h3>

			Whose woods these are I think I know.<br> His house is in the
			village though;<br> He will not see me stopping here<br> To
			watch his woods fill up with snow.<br> My little horse must
			think it queer<br> To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
			Between the woods and frozen lake<br> The darkest evening of the
			year.<br> He gives his harness bells a shake<br> To ask if
			there is some mistake.<br> The only other sound's the sweep<br>
			Of easy wind and downy flake.<br> The woods are lovely, dark and
			deep,<br> But I have promises to keep,<br> And miles to go
			before I sleep,<br> And miles to go before I sleep.

		<h3>Dolce et Decorum</h3>
		<img alt="Hell" src="./images/death.jpg">
		<p>
			Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br> Knock-kneed,
			coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br> Till on the
			haunting flares we turned our backs,<br> And towards our distant
			rest began to trudge.<br> Men marched asleep. Many had lost
			their boots,<br> But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all
			blind;<br> Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
			Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!-An ecstasy of fumbling<br> Fitting the
			clumsy helmets just in time,<br> But someone still was yelling
			out and stumbling<br> And flound'ring like a man in fire or
			lime.-<br> Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
			As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
		</p>
		<p>
			In all my dreams before my helpless sight,<br> He plunges at me,
			guttering, choking, drowning.
		</p>
		<p>
			If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br> Behind the
			wagon that we flung him in,<br> And watch the white eyes writhing in his
			face,<br> His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br> If you could
			hear, at every jolt, the blood<br> Come gargling from the froth-corrupted
			lungs,<br> Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br> Of vile, incurable sores
			on innocent tongues,-<br> My friend, you would not tell with such high
			zest<br> To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br> The old Lie: <i>Dulce
			et<br> decorum est Pro patria mori.</i>
