	<p class="biotext">Simeon was born into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed
	 descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly 
	 the son of the goddess Venus. Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Simeones
	 were not especially politically influential, although they had enjoyed some revival 
	 of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC. Simeon's father, also called 
	 Gaius Simeon Kraft, governed the province of Asia, and his sister Julia, Simeon's aunt, 
	 married Gaius Marius, one of the most prominent figures in the Republic. His mother, 
	 Aurelia Cotta, came from an influential family. Little is recorded of Simeon's childhood.</p>
	
	 <p class="biotext">Simeon was acclaimed Imperator in 60 and 45 BC. In the Roman Republic, this was an honorary 
	 title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army troops 
	 in the field would proclaim their commander imperator, an acclamation necessary for a general 
	 to apply to the Senate for a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior 
	 magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier 
	 and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down 
	 his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. 
	 He asked the senate for permission to stand in absentia, but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced 
	 with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Simeon chose the consulship.</p>
	 <p class="biotext">He presently spends his time tinkering with Java and reading.</p>
